## 2.0.0-alpha.3

### Breaking (within alpha)
- New TpuEvent variants: `stale-snapshot`, `ephemeral-identity` (replaces `console.warn`). Exhaustive switch consumers need `default:`.
- New TpuError kind: `rpc-error` (replaces misuse of `slot-subscription` by leader-cache).
- `AsyncSemaphore` gains an async `acquire()` method + wait queue (backward-compat: `tryAcquire` retained).

### Added
- `CreateTpuClientOptions.timeouts` for per-connection connect/write/destroy timeouts.
- `TpuClient.getStats()` returning `{ poolSize, inFlightSends, upcomingLeaders, quarantined, lastSnapshotAgeMs, lastSlotAgeMs, stakedKnown }`.
- Per-identity quarantine TTL (60s) rather than blanket clear on cluster-refresh.
- Input validation at `createTpuClient` (fanoutSlots 1..64, poolCap ≥1, maxStreamsPerConn ≥1).
- Default `poolCap` lowered from 1024 to 64 — closer to steady-state need.
- `LICENSE` file (MIT) on disk (was only referenced in `package.json`).
- Package keywords, proper description, sideEffects:false for tree-shaking.
- `noopEmitter` exported from barrel.

### Fixed
- 0-signature tx (tx[0] === 0) bypassed guards and reported a bogus signature. Now rejects with `{kind:'invalid-tx'}`.
- Malformed `tpuQuic` gossip entries no longer crash pool.acquire — `resolveTpuQuicAddr` returns null for unparseable addrs and the leader is skipped with `{kind:'no-tpu-addr'}`.
- `slotsInEpoch: 0n` defensive check — prevents divide-by-zero-like RPC-induced infinite loops.
- `stakedIdentities` refresh now validates bigint type and skips malformed entries.
- `attempts[]` in SendResult now in fanout-order (was completion-order, non-deterministic).
- slot-stall TpuEvent no longer spams (fires once per outage, not every 400ms).
- Pool `#drainAndClose` no longer busy-waits 25ms polling on refcount.
- Package.json `exports` map now has `types` before `import` (TS recommended order).
- README package-name references corrected throughout — install snippets and import examples now use the actual published name `tpu-client`.
- README Quickstart now notes it is a compilable skeleton; payer must be funded.
- README Reference `TpuIdentity` now lists `certPem` and `privateKeyPem`.

### Docs
- "Deployment checklist" and "Performance characteristics" sections.
- "Custom transport wrappers" example using `evaluatePinDecision`.
- Stale DESIGN.md / 00-overview.md updated to reflect alpha.2+.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2

### Breaking (within alpha)
- Split `TpuError` into `TpuLeaderError` + `TpuSendFailure` for better type narrowing. `TpuError` is kept as the backward-compat union.
- `LeaderAttempt` is now a discriminated union on `ok`: `{ok:true; rttMs}` | `{ok:false; error: TpuLeaderError}`.

### Fixed
- `close()` drain race where sends started after `closing=true` were lost (RT2-C1).
- `close()` hang when a send is stuck on QUIC backpressure — now accepts `timeoutMs` option (default 5 s).
- `TpuConfirmOptions.abortSignal` is now optional; defaults to a no-op signal when absent.
- Short tx bytes now throw `{kind:'invalid-tx', reason:'tx too short'}` instead of wrongly labeled `'all-failed'`.
- Transactions with >=128 signatures are now rejected explicitly with `{kind:'invalid-tx'}`.

### Added
- `invalid-tx` `TpuSendFailure` variant.
- `TpuLeaderError` and `TpuSendFailure` re-exported from the barrel for granular type narrowing.
- `evaluatePinDecision` re-exported from the barrel (useful for testing custom transport wrappers).
- `peerDependencies` for `@solana/kit`, `@matrixai/quic`, `@peculiar/x509` (was `dependencies`).
- CI Node 23 matrix entry + `npm pack --dry-run` verification step.
- Nightly CI job (`smoke-firedancer`) probing mainnet-beta to catch cert/ALPN changes.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1 (unreleased)

### Changed

- **Cert pinning is now `'observe'` by default** (was effectively `'strict'` in alpha.0). Empirical mainnet probing (April 2026, 6-node comparative sample) revealed that 100% of Frankendancer validators and a meaningful fraction of Agave validators present server certs whose SPKI does **not** equal the gossip-advertised identity pubkey — likely due to per-connection ephemeral certs or load-balancer TLS termination. Strict pinning silently broke ~20%+ of the leader schedule.
  - New option `CreateTpuClientOptions.pinMode: 'strict' | 'observe' | 'off'`, default `'observe'`.
  - `observe` accepts the connection on SPKI mismatch but still emits `cert-pin-mismatch` TpuEvent for telemetry.
  - `strict` preserves v2.0.0-alpha.0 behavior — safe for pure-Agave fleets that you know present identity-signed certs.
  - `off` skips the SPKI check entirely; client cert is still presented for QoS.
- Quarantine is now only populated by `strict`-mode mismatches (an `observe`-mode mismatch succeeded the handshake; quarantining it would lock the client out of legitimate leaders).
- New exported pure function `evaluatePinDecision` — unit-testable pin-decision logic without a live QUIC handshake.

## 2.0.0-alpha.0 (initial)

### Breaking

- **Rewritten on `@solana/kit` 3.x.** Drops `@solana/web3.js` v1 dependency entirely.
- **`TpuConnection` removed.** Use the `createTpuClient` factory instead.
- **ESM-only.** CommonJS `require()` is not supported.
- **Node ≥ 22.11 required.** Node 20 is approaching EOL (2026-04-30) and does not ship the WebCrypto Ed25519 API used by the identity module.
- **`sendRawTransaction` return type changed** from `string` to `{ signature: Signature; attempts: LeaderAttempt[] }`. All callers must be updated.
- **`sendTransaction(tx, signers)` removed.** Build signed wire bytes with `@solana/kit` and call `sendRawTransaction(bytes)`.
- **`sendAbortableTransaction` removed.** Pass `{ signal }` to `sendRawTransaction`.
- **`sendAndConfirmRawTransaction` removed.** Use `sendAndConfirmTpuTransactionFactory`.

### Added

- `createTpuClient(opts)` factory — async, returns after priming slot tracker and leader cache.
- `sendAndConfirmTpuTransactionFactory(cfg)` — kit-idiomatic send + confirm helper; races block-height expiry vs. signature status.
- **Staked QoS** via `opts.identity: CryptoKeyPair` — Ed25519 client cert presented in QUIC `ClientHello` for stake-weighted stream allocation.
- `ed25519KeyPairFromSolanaSecret(bytes)` — import a 64-byte `solana-keygen` JSON file into a `CryptoKeyPair`.
- `ed25519KeyPairFromSeed(seed)` — import a 32-byte Ed25519 seed into a `CryptoKeyPair`.
- **Server cert pubkey pinning** — leader Ed25519 pubkey extracted from peer X.509 cert and matched against gossip identity; mismatch quarantines the leader for the epoch.
- `onEvent: (e: TpuEvent) => void` observability hook with stable discriminated union.
- `TpuEvent` union: `ready`, `slot`, `slot-stall`, `leaders-refresh`, `cluster-refresh`, `conn-open`, `conn-close`, `conn-evict`, `cert-pin-mismatch`, `send`, `error`.
- `close()` — graceful drain of in-flight sends; idempotent.
- Epoch-boundary leader schedule union via `getLeaderSchedule(nextEpoch)` — fetched within 64 slots of boundary to avoid `getSlotLeaders` errors at epoch end.
- Slot stall watchdog — falls back to `getSlot` polling if no `slotNotification` for >2 s; recovers silently when WS resumes.
- Cold-start fallback — `getSlot` (400 ms TTL cache) populates initial slot while the WS estimator accumulates K=12 samples.
- `@matrixai/quic` ALPN set to `solana-tpu` — required by Firedancer; silently accepted by Agave.
- Per-connection stream semaphore (128 staked / 8 unstaked default) with fast-fail `BackpressureError`.
- LRU connection pool with cap 1024 and 30 s idle eviction.

### Fixed

- Uninitialized `last_epoch_info_slot` causing spurious first-tick leader refetches.
- Dead `last_cluster_refresh` timer that never updated — cluster node list was fetched once at startup and never refreshed.
- Fire-and-forget `sendRawTransaction` that returned before QUIC writes completed — callers could not observe send errors.
- Missing ALPN negotiation — Firedancer rejects QUIC connections without `solana-tpu`; previously sent without ALPN.
- Deprecated `onSlotUpdate` subscription replaced with `slotNotifications`.
- `tpuQuic` null gossip entries no longer panic — falls back to `tpu + 6` port heuristic, or emits `no-tpu-addr` attempt and skips the leader gracefully.
